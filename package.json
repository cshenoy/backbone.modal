  "readme": "## Backbone.Modal\n\nA plugin for Backbone.js that simplifies creating modals for your application.\n\nBackbone.Modal.js removes boilerplate code and adds default behaviors and interactions. You can create a simple dialog modal or complex wizards with stacked modals on top of each other in a few lines of code.\n\nFor a complete overview of the documentation visit: [http://awkward.github.io/backbone.modal/](http://awkward.github.io/backbone.modal/)\n\n#### Bundled version\nIf you're using Backbone and Marionette.\n* [backbone.modal-bundled-min.js](https://raw.github.com/awkward/backbone.modal/master/backbone.modal-bundled-min.js)\n\n#### Backbone.Modals.js and Backbone.Marionette.Modals.js separate\nIf you just want to use the Backbone version without Marionette.\n* [backbone.modal-min.js](https://raw.github.com/awkward/backbone.modal/master/backbone.modal-min.js)\n* [backbone.marionette.modals-min.js](https://raw.github.com/awkward/backbone.modal/master/backbone.marionette.modals-min.js)\n\n#### CSS files\nThere's default style, and you can use our theme to make things look pretty.\n* [backbone.modal.css](https://raw.github.com/awkward/backbone.modal/master/backbone.modal.css)\n* [backbone.modal.theme.css](https://raw.github.com/awkward/backbone.modal/master/backbone.modal.theme.css)\n\n### How to contribute\n\nTo get started `grunt install` to install all dependencies. If you have any requests, please create an issue. If you're working on something yourself, make a pull request and we'll make sure to check it out to get in into the next release.\n\n### Tests\n\nWhen you run the project by doing `grunt watch`. This will watch the tests, src and example files. It will open up a browser with the tests on `http://localhost:8000`. When you head over `http://localhost:5000`, it will show the example that's defined in the `Gruntfile.coffee`.\n\n### Legal stuff (MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Awkward.\n\nDistributed under MIT license.\n",
